"""Behaviour tests for safecall skills.

A skill is a piece of prose that is supposed to change what an AI DOES. A test that
greps SKILL.md for a sentence proves only that the sentence was typed. This runner
proves the sentence works: it hands a real model the skill and a situation, and then
checks what the model actually said.

Every assertion here is deterministic (regular expressions over the answer). No model
judges another model, so a green run means the same thing tomorrow.

The important assertions are NEGATIVE. "They agree" is not tested by looking for the
word "agree"; it is tested by checking the model does NOT say it when only one of the
two answers can be quoted.

Run:
    python3 tests/behavior/run.py --model grok
    python3 tests/behavior/run.py --model codex --case receipt-no-all-clear
    python3 tests/behavior/run.py --model agy --jobs 4

Models (the point is that the model running this is NOT the model that wrote the skill):
    grok   grok -p ... -m grok-4.6 --permission-mode dontAsk
    codex  codex exec --skip-git-repo-check ...
    agy    agy -p ... --model gemini-3.1-pro-high --sandbox
    claude claude -p --model opus ...          (author's own voice - not independent)

Exit code 0 only if every case passed.
